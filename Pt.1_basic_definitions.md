> Logic is the science of argument evaluation

# Defining statements

`Arguments` – are sets (groups) of statements.

- One statement by itself never constitutes an argument.
- Statements are sentences, capable of being True or False

Some statements (`Premises`) claim to be support/reasons for another 
(`Conclusion`).

`Premises` – statements that give evidence

`Conclusions` – statements that receive the support from premises

`Truth Value` – the truth or falsity of a statement

`Proposition` – the meaning or content of a statement

`Inference` – the reasoning process of an argument

> Premises
>> All film stars are celebrities
>> Halle Berry is a film star
>
> Conclusion
>> Halle Berry is a celebrity

# Not a statement

Some Sentences or utterances are not statements:

- Questions
- Exclamations
- Imperatives/Commands
- Instructions
- Advices
- Warnings
- Informing/Reports
- Expositions (lengthy talks about some topic)
- Illustrations
- Explanations (sometimes they are)

These can not have a Truth-value, because they don't assert anything 
about the way the world is, therefore they can not be True or False,
therefore they can not be Statements, and they can not be Premises
or Conclusions and Arguments.

# Indicator words

## Conclusion indicator words

- therefore
- accordingly
- entails that
- wherefore
- we may conclude
- hence
- thus
- it must be that
- it follows that
- consequently
- for this reason
- implies that we may infer
- so
- as a result
- ...

> Tortured prisoners will confess to nearly anything
> 
> `Consequently`, torture is not a reliable method for obtaining information

## Premise indicator words

- since
- in that
- seeing that
- as indicated by
- may be inferred from
- for the reason that
- because
- as
- inasmuch as
- for
- given that
- owing to
- ...

> Parents should never shake a crying baby, `since` the baby's delicate
> body and brain might be easily traumatized.

### Premises VS Conclusions

Here `reason` indicates a conclusion:

> McDonald's has fatty foods. For this `reason` I should go to Subway

Here `reason` indicates a Premise:

> I should go to Subway for the `reason` that McDonald's has fatty foods

### Several Premises with one indicator

One indicator word may signal several Premises:

> Since `my company is in red` and `I'm not seeing hope of recovery`, 
> I should file for bankruptcy.

### No indicator words

Frog says:

> I shouldn't cross the road. It's rush hour. And the last two frogs
> were flattened


# Conditions for an Argument

There must be 2 conditions for a sentence to be considered an Argument:

1. At least one statement (premise) must contain an evidence
2. There must be a claim (conclusion), that alleged evidence supports

These both are 2 statements (claims), first with the evidence (`factual claim`),
and the second with a conclusion, derived from that evidence 
(`inferential claim`).

`Factual claim` – **not** evaluated by logic

`inferential/support claim` – **is** evaluated by logic

If there is a `factual claim` but no `inferential claim` – there is no Argument.

## Spotting inferences

> `As` Einstein developed his relativity theory he was unknowingly laying 
> the groundwork for quantum theory.
> 
> `Since` Einstein published his theories, quantum theory has enjoyed many 
> successes.

Here the word `Since` is not an indicator word for a Premise, it's just a 
time-indicator => no inference here.

> `Since` quantum theory was not likely to develop without Einstein's work,
> Einstein deserves some credit for quantum theory, despite the fact that he
> disliked it.

In this case there is an infer => `Since` is used as a premise indicator,
and there is a conclusion.
