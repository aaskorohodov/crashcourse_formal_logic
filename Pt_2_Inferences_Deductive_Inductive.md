Two key elements of an Argument:

1. Are the premises True? (not what logic analyzes)
2. To what degree do they support the conclusion? (is what logic analyzes)

Logic is the "science of support", not truth. Logic can not tell, if a Premise
or Conclusion is truth, but it can tel, if there is a link between them.

## Types of logical support

**Deductive** – There is no possibility of the conclusion being false when 
the premises are true. The conclusion is contained in the premises.

> Ravens 1 thru 4 are black
>> Ravens 1 thru 4 are each distinct ravens (1!=2, 2!=3, ...)
>>> There are at least 4 black ravens

The conclusion can not be false, if both premises are true.

**Inductive** – The premises merely make the conclusion likely. The conclusion
goes beyond the premises.

In real life it goes more like so:

> Ravens 1 thru 4 are black
>> Also, ravens 5 thru 10_000 are black and are distinct
>>> All ravens are black

We did not test all ravens in the world, but we got a pretty strong premises.

To turn the last Inductive type of support into deductive, we need to add this:

> Ravens 1 thru 4 are black
>> Also, ravens 5 thru 10_000 are black and are distinct
>>> There are only 10_000 ravens exists <-----
>>>> All ravens are black

The main difference, is that:

> If "Support-meter" for premises (evidences) hit 100% -> This is a deductive
> support.
> 
> If "Support-meter" did not hit 100% -> Inductive support.

## Indicators

Deductive:

- Necessarily
- Certainly
- Absolutely
- Definitely
- ...

Inductive:

- Probable
- Improbable
- Plausible
- Implausible
- Likely
- Unlikely
- ...

## Forms of Inductive Logic

- Generalization
- Arguments from Analogy
- Arguments based on signs
- Causal inferences
- Arguments from authority
- Predictions

**Generalization** – getting from knowledge of a sample to knowledge of 
the whole group.

Prem: As a dog I howl at the moon every night
Concl: All dogs howl at the moon

**Analogy** – an argument that infers a further similarity between 2 things,
based on some other known similarity.

Prem: All rats that ate X got sick
Prem: Humans and rats have many relevant similarities
Concl: If human would eat X, Human would get sick

**Arguments based on signs** – like an actual signs on the road tells you
something, for example that there is a turn right ahead. Or when clock tells
you time.

**Causal inferences** – Arguments, that proceed from the knowledge of a cause
to the knowledge of the effect, or wise verse.

**Arguments from authority** – inference rests upon a statement made by 
authority or witness.

**Predictions** – conclusion geos from current or past event into the future.
